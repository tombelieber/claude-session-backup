Every debugging session. Every architecture decision. Every prompt you spent an hour crafting. Gone.

WhatsApp keeps your messages forever. Telegram keeps them forever. Discord keeps them forever. Claude Code — the tool you pay $20–200/mo for — gives you 30 days.

<div align="center">

```bash
npx claude-backup
```

**One command. Your sessions are safe. Auto-syncs daily.**

</div>

## What You're Losing

Claude Code stores everything in `~/.claude/` — your settings, custom agents, hooks, skills, and **every conversation you've ever had**. Sessions older than 30 days? Silently deleted.

Each session is:

- A **debugging journal** — the exact steps that fixed that impossible bug
- An **architecture record** — why you chose that pattern, with the AI's reasoning
- A **prompt library** — the carefully worded instructions that actually worked
- A **learning log** — mistakes, corrections, breakthroughs, all timestamped

You can't Google your own Claude sessions. Once they're gone, they're gone.

---

## How It Works

```bash
npx claude-backup
```

Interactive setup:

1. Checks requirements (git, gzip, python3)
2. Creates a private GitHub repo (or local-only if you prefer)
3. Backs up your config and all sessions (gzipped)
4. Sets up automatic backups (configurable: daily, 6h, hourly)

That's it. Run it once, forget about it.

---

## Get Your Sessions Back

Browse and restore any session from your backups:

```bash
# List all backed-up sessions
claude-backup restore --list

# Show the last 5 sessions
claude-backup restore --last 5

# Filter by date
claude-backup restore --date 2026-02-27

# Filter by project
claude-backup restore --project myproject

# Restore a specific session
claude-backup restore <uuid>
```

The session index is auto-generated on every sync and rebuilt from the `*.jsonl.gz` files — you never need to manage it manually.

---

## What Gets Saved

**Config profile** — settings, CLAUDE.md, agents, hooks, skills, rules. Lightweight (< 100 KB), portable between machines.

**Sessions archive** — all chat history, compressed with gzip. Your entire conversation history, safe in a private repo.

<summary><strong>Full backup manifest</strong></summary>
<br>

| Item | Source | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Settings | `settings.json` | Plugins, preferences |
| Local settings | `settings.local.json` | Permission overrides |
| User instructions | `CLAUDE.md` | User-level system prompt |
| Custom agents | `agents/` | Agent definitions |
| Custom hooks | `hooks/` | Automation scripts |
| Custom skills | `skills/` | User-authored skills |
| Custom rules | `rules/` | Custom rules |
| Session files | `projects/**/*.jsonl` | Chat history (gzipped) |
| Session indexes | `projects/**/sessions-index.json` | Session metadata |
| Command history | `history.jsonl` | CLI command history (gzipped) |

All source paths are relative to `~/.claude/`.

## Machine Migration

Your config took hours to perfect. Move it in seconds.

```bash
# Old machine
claude-backup export-config
# => ~/claude-config-2026-02-25.tar.gz (47 KB)

# Transfer via AirDrop, USB, email, etc.

# New machine
npx claude-backup import-config claude-config-2026-02-25.tar.gz
```

Plugins are not included in the export (they are re-downloaded on first launch). Only the plugin manifest in `settings.json` is backed up.

---

## Backend Modes

Choose where your backups live:

```bash
# GitHub private repo (default if gh is installed)
npx claude-backup

# Local only — no remote, no GitHub needed
npx claude-backup --local

# Custom git remote
npx claude-backup --backend git
claude-backup backend set git --remote git@myserver:backups.git
```

Switch backends anytime — even after setup:

```bash
claude-backup backend set github   # switch to GitHub
claude-backup backend set local    # switch to local-only
claude-backup backend set git --remote <url>  # custom remote
```

Backups go to `~/.claude-backup/` as a local git repo. Everything works the same — sync, restore, peek, export/import.

---

## Backup Schedule

Control how often backups run:

```bash
claude-backup schedule daily    # Every day at 3:00 AM (default)
claude-backup schedule 6h       # Every 6 hours
claude-backup schedule hourly   # Every hour
claude-backup schedule off      # Disable automatic backups
```

---

## Restore Everything

Restore all sessions at once — useful for a fresh machine or disaster recovery:

```bash
claude-backup restore --all             # restore every session
claude-backup restore --all --force     # overwrite existing sessions
```

---

## Claude Code Plugin

Let Claude manage backups for you:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add tombelieber/claude-backup
/plugin install claude-backup
```

The plugin teaches Claude the CLI commands. The agent always uses `--json` for structured output.

<summary><strong>Security</strong></summary>
<br>

- **Credentials are never backed up.** `.credentials.json` and `.encryption_key` are hardcoded exclusions.
- **GitHub repo is private** by default.
- **`export-config` warns** if any file appears to contain sensitive content (tokens, secrets, passwords).
- **`import-config` does not overwrite** existing credentials.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>What's Excluded</strong></summary>
<br>

| Item | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `.credentials.json` | Auth tokens — security risk |
| `.encryption_key` | Encryption key — security risk |
| `plugins/` | Re-downloadable from registry |
| `debug/`, `file-history/` | Transient logs and edit history |
| `cache/`, `.search_cache/`, `.tmp/`, `paste-cache/` | Caches, rebuilt automatically |
| `session-env/`, `shell-snapshots/` | Runtime state |
| `statsig/`, `telemetry/`, `usage-data/` | Analytics, not user data |
| `todos/`, `teams/`, `plans/`, `ide/` | Ephemeral per-session data |

Sessions are namespaced by machine — backups from multiple devices stay organized and searchable. Existing v3.1 backups are auto-migrated on first sync.

| Location | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| `~/.claude-backup/` | Local compressed backups + git repo |
| `github.com/<you>/claude-backup-data` | Remote private repo |
| `~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.claude-backup.plist` | macOS scheduler |

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Requirements</strong></summary>
<br>

- **macOS** (Linux coming soon)
- **git**
- **gzip** (built-in on macOS)
- **python3** (built-in on macOS since Catalina)
- **gh** ([GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com)) — *optional*. Enables remote backup. Without it, backups are local-only.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Uninstall</strong></summary>
<br>

```bash
claude-backup uninstall
```

Removes the daily scheduler and optionally deletes local backup data. Delete the GitHub repo separately:

```bash
gh repo delete claude-backup-data
```
